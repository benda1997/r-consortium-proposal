The School of Data is a network of people all over the world who are enthusiastic about data. 
The aim of the network is to improve data literacy among people who can do good with data. One
of the target groups are journalists. Our R consortium grant project focuses on teaching R to journalists in a way
that is interesting and relevant to journalists in different countries. This means we will 
develop material with content relevant for journalists and in different languages (English, 
French, Spanish and German).
