## The Problem

## The Plan

- Use lessons already available (e.g. [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/), 
[existing school of data tutorials](http://www.datactivi.st/IntroR_ODF/)).
If needed, translate material.
- Buil ontop of these tutorials to address focus group with focused material 
including relevant data sets and relevant techniques.
- Make all material available to use and develop further or adjust
for different focus groups (e.g. via GitHub).

## How Can The ISC Help?

- Financially by supporting salary of material developers and teachers.
- Financially by paying for travel costs of teachers.
- Financially by paying for workshop rooms.

## Dissemination
