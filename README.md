## The Problem
R has great tools for accessing and analysing open data sources, which would be hugely beneficial to civil society organisations (CSOs) and journalists. However there is a low level of awareness of R in these communities
and specialized courses -- especially in languages other than English -- are not available.


## The Plan

- Use lessons already available (e.g. [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/), 
[existing school of data tutorials](http://www.datactivi.st/IntroR_ODF/)).
If needed, translate material.
- Buil ontop of these tutorials to address focus groups (CSOs and journalists 
in different countries) with focused material 
including relevant data sets, techniques and repositories to make code and
results freely available.
- Make all material available to use and develop further or adjust
for different focus groups (e.g. via GitHub).

## How Can The ISC Help?

- Financially by supporting salary of material developers and teachers.
- Financially by paying for travel costs of teachers and workshop rooms to 
organize workshops in Ghana, Costa Rica, France and Switzerland.
