# Protocol of the call January 3 2017

People:
- Camila Salazar
- David Opoku
- Joel Gombin
- Malick Lingani
- Samuel Goeta
- Heidi Seibold




## Goals

- Target journalists (maybe CSOs / people who work on advocacy issues, depending on similarity of wishes to journalists) 
who have some experience in working with data.
- Create contextualised resources, specific to journalists needs (adapt datasets and examples)
- Languages: French, Spanish, German, English
- Material should be modular, so it can be reused
- Material should be focused on self learning (possibly also usable in workshops)
- We want to reuse existing material/infrastructure, if possible
- First section of material should convince journalists to use R (low entry barriers, no installations at first)
- Test the material in workshops (in different countries around the world)


## TODOs and responsibilities:

Before next call (end of January):

- Samuel / Joel: Check out existing material (https://rddj.info/, datactivist, Joel => mapping capabilities) 
- Camila / David / Joel: What do DDJs need?
- Heidi: Costs, what do we need money for?
- David: Timeline for material creation
- Joel : check out possible forms of the material: 
RStudio instance (cost) / [datacamp light](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light);
consider limited internet access in some countries 
(avoid heavy files and need of staying connected for developing countries)

In February:

- Heidi / Malick : Writing the proposal
