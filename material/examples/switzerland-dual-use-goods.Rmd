Dual-use goods are goods that can be used for civil and military purposes. 
In Switzerland, these goods are governed with a special legislation â€“ 
unlike in other countries, where they are looked at as conventional arms exports. 

Thanks to [SRF data](https://github.com/srfdata/2017-01-dual-use) we have 
access to the raw dual-use data in Switzerland (2012 - 2016) as well as data 
cleaning procedures in R.

## What can be learned using this data?

- Reading excel files (data are given to the user in xlsx format); package `xlsx`
- Data cleaning; packages `tidyr`, `dplyr`
- Automation (data is realeased every year and can simply be added to the script)
- Plausability checks
- Saving data as csv so it can be passed on
- Reproducibility by using GitHub, thorough documentation, `rmarkdown`
- Visualisation with `ggplot2`
- Publishing with github pages
