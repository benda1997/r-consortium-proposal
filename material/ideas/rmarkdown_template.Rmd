# Howto

If you work with RStudio:

- Go to File -> New File -> R Markdown
- Enter title, e.g. *Data pipeline step 1: Ask*
- Enter your name as author
- Click *OK*
- Save file in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/school-of-data/r-consortium-proposal)
  under `/r-consortium-proposal/material/lessons`; Naming should be sensible, such as
  `pipeline_1_ask.Rmd` for the document that explains the *ASK* step of the data pipeline.
- Add your text
- Push the *knit* button (or use `rmarkdown::render("rmarkdown_template.Rmd")`)
