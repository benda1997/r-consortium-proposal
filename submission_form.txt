School of Data Material Development

11200 (+ 7000)

We would like to develop R learning material for journalists in four different 
languages.

We are aware of sending in the proposal after the deadline and have been in 
contact about this with Gabor Csardi.  
We would be very grateful if you would consider our proposal.
